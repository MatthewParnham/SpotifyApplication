# SpotifyApplication
## Matthew Parnham, Alex Rigl, Rielle Dizon

### Description
Enter two spotify user names.  Authenticate your account.  A new playlist will be generated with common interests of both accounts.  If not enough common songs exist (or none at all), songs will be selected from both user's libraries in an alternating fashion.





### Python Application

#### Instructions
* Make sure Spotipy Library is installed with "pip install spotipy"
* In a shell, run 'python app.py'. Enter your friend's username.
* Now, Enter your username as instructed.
* Your browser will open and you will be prompted to allow access. Click Accept.
* You will then be redirected to Google.  Copy your URL and paste it into your shell. Hit Enter.
* You should now see a new playlist on your Spotify account with common songs between you and your friend.

### Website Demo

#### Instructions
* Visit alexrigl.com for the first demonstration that shows a two module setup
* Visit alexrigl.com/index.html for the second demonstration that shows a one module setup
* The spotify script does not work properly, but the website runs a python script that takes in a username, and runs a script with the username, this is meant to show python working on the website because the spotipy library is not working properly on the server, even after making a dedicated virtual environment with the library installed. 
* Look in the html folder README for more information
